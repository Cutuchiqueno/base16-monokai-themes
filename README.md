# base16-monokai-themes

created or modified [base16-monokai](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) color themes for:

- taskwarrior
- *alot (to come)*
- *rofi (to come)*
- *termite (to come)*
- *Xressources (to come)*

All base16-monokai themes are dark versions of the theme. I use [base16-shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell) which means that some base16 colors are transfered to colors 17-21 so that 'bright' color names still match there corresponding colors.
